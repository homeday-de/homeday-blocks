# Spacing

Spacing values range from 2px to 64px and all of them are defined as SASS variables.

|     | Value | Variable |
| --- | ----- | -------- |
| XXS | 2px   | $sp-xxs  |
| XS  | 4px   | $sp-xs   |
| S   | 8px   | $sp-s    |
| M   | 16px  | $sp-m    |
| L   | 32px  | $sp-l    |
| XL  | 64px  | $sp-xl   |

### Usage examples:

```css
.homeday-block {
  padding: $sp-s $sp-l;
  margin-bottom: $sp-xl;
}
```
