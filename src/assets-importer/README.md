# Assets Importer

### Prerequisites
Make sure that you have a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project with the variable `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN`

E.g:
```
# .env.local
FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxx-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx
```

âš  **Do not commit this file.**

### Terminology
A collection is a set of assets that share the same configuration.

### Configuration
In the CONFIG.js file you can add/remove/edit your collections inside `COLLECTIONS` *(Array)*.

Each entry should contain the following properties:

`name` *(String)* A unique name of your choice for the collection.
`figmaFileKey` *(String)* The key of the Figma file
`matchingRegex` *(RegExp)* The regular expression that the component's name should match to be imported.
`filenameRegex` *(RegExp)* A regular expression to generate the new file name based on the original component name.
`dist` *(String)* A path to the directory where the files will be saved.
`format` *(String)* The format you want for the image (The currently supported formats: jpg, png, svg, and pdf).

### How to use
**To import all the collections:**
```
npm run import-assets
```
**To import one specific collection:**
```
npm run import-assets -- collectionName
```
`collectionName` should match the `name` property of your collections.

### Todos:
- Use functions instead of RegExp.
